<em class="word1">A Thestral is a breed of winged horses with a 
skeletal body, face with reptilian features
, and wide, leathery wings that resemble a bat's. They are very rare, and
 are considered dangerous by the Ministry of Magic. Thestrals are, undeser
 vedly, known as omens of misfortune and aggression by many wizards because 
 they are visible only to those who have witnessed death at least once (and 
 fully accepted the concept) or due to their somewhat grim, gaunt and 
 ghostly appearance

nearby and scrambled clumsily on to the horses silken back. It did not object, but twisted its
head around,

 bared, and attempted to continue its eager licking of his robes.
</p>
<p>
He found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing joints that made him feel
more secure, then looked around at the others. Neville had heaved himself over the back of
the next Thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature's back.
Luna was already in place, sitting side-saddle and adjusting her robes as though she did this
every day. Ron, Hermione and Ginny, however, were still standing motionless on the spot,
open-mouthed and staring.</p>
<p>'What?' he said.</p>
<p>'How're we supposed to get on?' said Ron faintly. 'When we can't see the things?'</p>
<p>'Oh, it's easy,' said Luna, sliding obligingly from her Thestral and marching over to him,
Hermione and Ginny. 'Come here…'</p>
<p>She pulled them over to the other Thestrals standing around and one by one managed to help
them on to the back of their mount. All three looked extremely nervous as she wound their
hands into their horses mane and told them to grip tightly before she got back on to her own
steed.</p>
<p>This is mad,' Ron murmured, moving his free hand gingerly up and down his horse's neck.
'Mad… if I could just see it -'</p>

<p>'You'd better hope it stays invisible,' said Harry darkly. 'We all ready, then?'
</p><p>They all nodded and he saw five pairs of knees tighten beneath their robes.
</p><p>'OK…'</p>
<p>He looked down at the back of his Thestral's glossy black head and swallowed.<p>
<p>'Ministry of Magic, visitors' entrance, London, then,' he said uncertainly. 'Er… if you know…
where to go…"</p>

<p> For a moment Harry's Thestral did nothing at all; then, with a sweeping movement that
nearly unseated him, the wings on either side extended; the horse crouched slowly, then
rocketed upwards so fast and so steeply that Harry had to clench his arms and legs tightly
around the horse to avoid sliding backwards over its bony rump. He closed his eyes and
pressed his face down into the horse's silky mane as they burst through the topmost branches
of the trees and soared out into a blood-red sunset. </p>
<p> Harry did not think he had ever moved so fast: the Thestral streaked over the castle, its wide
wings hardly beating; the cooling air was slapping Harry's face; eyes screwed up against the
rushing wind, he looked round and saw his five fellows soaring along behind him, each of
them bent as low as possible into the neck of their Thestral to protect themselves from his
slipstream. </p>
<p> They were over the Hogwarts grounds, they had passed

 <u class="word1">Hogsmeade

in Britain. It was founded by Hengist of Woodcroft.

; Harry could see
mountains and gullies below them. As the daylight began to fail, Harry saw small collections
of lights as they passed over more villages, then a winding road on which a single car was
beetling its way home through the hills… </p>
<p> This is bizarre!' Harry barely heard Ron yell from somewhere behind him, and he imagined
how it must feel to be speeding along at this height with no visible means of support. </p>
<p> Twilight fell: the sky was turning to a light, dusky purple littered with tiny silver stars, and
soon only the lights of Muggle towns gave them any clue of how far from the ground they
were, or how very fast they were travelling. Harry's arms were wrapped tightly around his
horses neck as he willed it to go even faster. How much time had elapsed since he had seen
Sirius lying on the Department of Mysteries floor? How much longer would Sinus be able to
resist Voldemort? All Harry knew for sure was that his godfather had neither done as
Voldemort wanted, nor died, for he was convinced that either outcome would have caused
him to feel Voldemort's jubilation or fury course through his own body, making his scar sear
as painfully as it had on the night Mr Weasley was attacked. </p>
<p> On they flew through the gathering darkness; Harry's face felt stiff and cold, his legs numb
from gripping the Thestrals sides so tightly, but he did not dare shift his position lest he slip…
he was deaf from the thundering rush of air in his ears, and his mouth was dry and frozen
from the cold night wind. He had lost all sense of how far they had come; all his faith was in
the beast beneath him, still streaking purposefully through the night, barely flapping its wings
as it sped ever onwards. </p>
<p> If they were too late… </p>
<p> He's still alive, he's still fighting, I can feel it… </p><p>  </p>
<p> If Voldemort decided Sirius was not going to crack… </p>
<p> I'd know… </p>
<p> Harrys stomach gave a jolt; the Thestrals head was suddenly pointing towards the ground
and he actually slid forwards a few inches along its neck. They were descending at last… he
thought he heard a shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously, but could see no sign
of a falling body .'.. presumably they had all received a shock from the change of direction,
just as he had. </p>
<p> And now bright orange lights were growing larger and rounder on all sides; they could see
the tops of buildings, streams of headlights like luminous insect eyes, squares of pale yellow
that were windows. Quite suddenly, it seemed, they were hurtling towards the pavement;
Harry gripped the Thestral with every last ounce of his strength, braced for a sudden impact,
but the horse touched the dark ground as lightly as a shadow and Harry slid from its back,
looking around at the street where the overflowing skip still stood a short way from the
vandalised telephone box, both drained of colour in the flat orange glare of the streetlights. </p>
<p> Ron landed a short way off and toppled immediately from his Thestral on to the pavement. </p>
<p> 'Never again,' he said, struggling to his feet. He made as though to stride away from his
Thestral, but, unable to see it, collided with its hindquarters and almost fell over again.
'Never, ever again… that was the worst -' </p>
<p> Hermione and Ginny touched down on either side of him: both slid off their mounts a little
more gracefully than Ron, though with similar expressions of relief at being back on firm
ground; Neville jumped down, shaking; and Luna dismounted smoothly. </p>
<p> 'Where do we go from here, then?' she asked Harry in a politely interested voice, as though
this was all a rather interesting day-trip. </p>
<p> 'Over here,' he said. He gave his Thestral a quick, grateful pat, then led the way quickly to the
battered telephone box and opened the door. 'Come on!' he urged the others, as they hesitated. </p>
<p> Ron and Ginny marched in obediently; Hermione, Neville and Luna squashed themselves in
after them; Harry took one glance back at the Thestrals, now foraging for scraps of rotten food
inside the skip, then forced himself into the box after Luna. </p>
<p> 'Whoever's nearest the receiver, dial six two four four two!' he said. </p>
<p> Ron did it, his arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial; as it whirred back into place the cool
female voice sounded inside the box. </p>
<p> 'Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.' </p>
<p> 'Harry Potter, Ron Weasley Hermione Granger,' Harry said very quickly, 'Ginny Weasley,
Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood… we're here to save someone, unless your Ministry can
do it first!' </p>
<p> Thank you,' said the cool female voice. 'Visitors, please take the badges and attach them to the
front of your robes.' </p>
<p> Half a dozen badges slid out of the metal chute where returned coins normally appeared.
Hermione scooped them up and handed them mutely to Harry over Ginny's head; he glanced
at the topmost one, Harry Potter, Rescue Mission. </p>
<p> 'Visitors to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wands for
registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.' </p>
<p> 'Fine!' Harry said loudly, as his scar gave another throb. 'Now can we move?' </p>
<p> The floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose up past its glass windows;
the scavenging Thestrals were sliding out of sight; blackness closed over their heads and with
a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the Ministry of Magic. </p>
<p> A chink of soft golden light hit their feet and, widening, rose up their bodies. Harry bent his
knees and held his wand as ready as he could in such cramped conditions as he peered
through the glass to see whether anybody was waiting for them in the Atrium, but it seemed
to be completely empty. The light was dimmer than it had been by day; there were no fires
burning under the mantelpieces set into the walls, but as the lift slid smoothly to a halt he saw
that golden symbols continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling. </p>
<p> The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant evening,' said the woman's voice. </p>
<p> The door of the telephone box burst open; Harry toppled out of it, closely followed by Neville
and Luna. The only sound in the Atrium was the steady rush of water from the golden
fountain, where jets from the wands of the witch and wizard, the point of the centaur's arrow,
the tip of the goblin's hat and the house-elf's ears continued to gush into the surrounding pool. </p>
<p> 'Come on,' said Harry quietly and the six of them sprinted off down the hall, Harry in the
lead, past the fountain towards the desk where the watchwizard who had weighed Harry's
wand had sat, and which was now deserted. </p>
<p> Harry felt sure there ought to be a security person there, sure their absence was an ominous
sign, and his feeling of foreboding increased as they passed through the golden gates to the
lifts. He pressed the nearest 'down' button and a lift clattered into sight almost immediately,
the golden grilles slid apart with a great, echoing clanking and they dashed inside. Harry
stabbed the number nine button; the grilles closed with a bang and the lift began to descend,
jangling and rattling. Harry had not realised how noisy the lifts were on the day he had come
with Mr Weasley; he was sure the din would raise every security person within the building,
yet when the lift halted, the cool female voice said, 'Department of Mysteries,' and the grilles
slid open. They stepped out into the corridor where nothing was moving but the nearest
torches, flickering in the rush of air from the lift. </p>
<p> Harry turned towards the plain black door. After months and months of dreaming about it,
he was here at last. </p>
<p> 'Let's go,' he whispered, and he led the way down the corridor, Luna right behind him, gazing
around with her mouth slightly open. </p>
<p> 'OK, listen,' said Harry stopping again within six feet of the door. 'Maybe… maybe a couple of
people should stay here as a — as a lookout, and -' </p>
<p> 'And how're we going to let you know something's coming?' asked Ginny, her eyebrows
raised. 'You could be miles away.' </p>
<p> 'We're coming with you, Harry,' said Neville. </p>
<p> 'Let's get on with it,' said Ron firmly. </p>
